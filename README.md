# 🌉 Health Bridge

**Sync your Fitbit data — including full HRV — from the Google Health API into Apple Health.**

Built for the Fitbit Air era, where the Google Health app reads *from* Apple Health but won't write your Fitbit data *back*. Health Bridge closes that gap with a tiny self‑hosted service and one Apple Shortcut.

## The problem

The new **Google Health** app (which replaced Fitbit in May 2026) will happily *read* your iPhone's Apple Health data — but as of now it does **not write your Fitbit data back into Apple Health**. Off‑the‑shelf Fitbit→Apple sync apps exist, but none carry **HRV**, the metric recovery apps like Bevel care about most.

**Health Bridge** pulls your Fitbit data straight from the official **Google Health API** (the successor to the Fitbit Web API), caches it in a small service you host, and exposes a clean JSON feed that an **Apple Shortcut** writes into Apple Health on a daily automation. No App Store app, no Apple Developer Program fee.

## How it works

```mermaid

    A[Fitbit Air] -->|Bluetooth| B[Google Health app]
    B -->|sync| C[(Google cloud)]
    C -->|"Google Health API · OAuth2"| D[Health Bridge backend]
    subgraph Server["Your server · Docker"]
        D --> E[(SQLite cache)]
        D -. "cron every 3h" .-> D
    end
    D -->|"GET /export · Bearer"| F[Apple Shortcut]
    F -->|"Log Health Sample"| G[Apple Health]
    G --> H[Bevel · Fitness · Rings]
```

A daily run looks like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Apple Shortcut (iPhone)
    participant B as Health Bridge
    participant G as Google Health API
    participant H as Apple Health

    Note over B,G: backend also pre-syncs every 3h
    S->>B: GET /export  (Bearer SHORTCUT_TOKEN)
    B->>G: refresh token → pull HRV, sleep, RHR, SpO2, …
    G-->>B: data points (FITBIT-sourced only)
    B-->>S: clean JSON { batchId, samples[] }
    loop each sample
        S->>H: Log Health Sample (value, unit, timestamp)
    end
    S->>B: POST /ack { batchId }
    B-->>S: cursor advanced (no duplicates next time)
```

## What gets synced

All field paths below were **verified against the live Google Health API**.

| Metric | Apple Health type | Source field |
|---|---|---|
| ❤️ **HRV — full intraday series** (~every 5 min) | Heart Rate Variability (SDNN) | `heartRateVariability.rootMeanSquareOfSuccessiveDifferencesMilliseconds` |
| ❤️ HRV nightly average *(fallback)* | Heart Rate Variability | `dailyHeartRateVariability.averageHeartRateVariabilityMilliseconds` |
| 💓 Resting heart rate | Resting Heart Rate | `dailyRestingHeartRate.beatsPerMinute` |
| 🫁 Blood oxygen (SpO₂) | Blood Oxygen Saturation | `dailyOxygenSaturation.averagePercentage` |
| 🌬️ Respiratory rate | Respiratory Rate | `dailyRespiratoryRate.breathsPerMinute` |
| 🏃 VO₂ max | VO₂ Max | `dailyVo2Max.vo2Max` |
| 😴 Sleep + stages | Sleep Analysis | `sleep.stages[]` (AWAKE / LIGHT / DEEP / REM) |
| 👟 Steps · Walking distance *(optional)* | Steps · Distance | `steps.count` · `distance.millimeters` |

## Design notes (the non‑obvious bits)

- **All HRV, not just a number.** The full intraday HRV series is written at each reading's real timestamp; the nightly average is only used for dates with no granular samples — so nothing's missed and nothing's double‑written.
- **Source filtering.** The API returns both `FITBIT` and `HEALTH_KIT` data (because Google Health pulls *in* your Apple data). Health Bridge keeps only `FITBIT` points, so it never writes your Apple Watch's own data back into Apple Health.
- **`list` vs `:reconcile`.** Daily summaries come from `list`; sessions (`sleep`, `steps`, `distance`) return an empty first page from `list` and must use `:reconcile`.
- **HRV units.** Fitbit reports HRV as RMSSD; Apple Health only has an SDNN field. The value is written into SDNN — perfect for tracking *your* trend, not comparable in absolute terms to an Apple Watch.
- **No duplicates.** A server‑side cursor + per‑sample dedup keys mean re‑running is always safe.
- **Steps/distance** duplicate the iPhone's native logging, so they're behind `SYNC_ACTIVITY` (set `0` to skip).

## Quick start

> Full, junior‑dev‑ready detail lives in [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md).

### 1. Google Cloud / OAuth (one‑time)
- Create a project, **enable the Google Health API**.
- OAuth consent screen → **External**. Add the three read‑only scopes:
  `…/googlehealth.health_metrics_and_measurements.readonly`,
  `…/googlehealth.sleep.readonly`,
  `…/googlehealth.activity_and_fitness.readonly`.
- Add yourself as a **test user** (the Fitbit/Google account). Create a **Web application** OAuth client.
- 💡 Verify your data is reachable first with [`scripts/PHASE0_TEST.md`](scripts/PHASE0_TEST.md).

### 2. Configure & run
```bash
cp .env.example .env      # fill in client id/secret; generate tokens with: openssl rand -hex 32
npm install
npm run dev               # or: npm run build && npm start
```

### 3. Deploy (Dokploy / any Docker host)
- Point a subdomain at the host, deploy the included `docker-compose.yml`, mount a volume at `/data`, enable HTTPS.
- Visit `https://your-domain/auth/start?admin=ADMIN_TOKEN` once and grant access.
- `curl -X POST https://your-domain/sync -H "Authorization: Bearer SHORTCUT_TOKEN"` → `{ "added": N }`.

### 4. The iPhone Shortcut
Build the "Sync Google Health → Apple Health" Shortcut and turn on a daily automation — step‑by‑step in [`shortcut/SHORTCUT_GUIDE.md`](shortcut/SHORTCUT_GUIDE.md).

## API

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | — | liveness + authorized flag |
| `GET` | `/auth/start?admin=…` | admin token | begin OAuth consent (one‑time) |
| `GET` | `/auth/callback` | (Google) | OAuth redirect target |
| `GET` | `/export` | Bearer | unsynced samples + `batchId` |
| `POST` | `/ack` | Bearer | advance the sync cursor |
| `POST` | `/sync` | Bearer | trigger a fetch from Google |
| `POST` | `/webhooks/google-health` | Bearer | future: push on new sleep data |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | — | your deployed URL |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | — | from Google Cloud |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | — | `…/auth/callback` (or the OAuth Playground while testing) |
| `GOOGLE_SCOPES` | — | the three read‑only Health scopes |
| `SHORTCUT_TOKEN` / `ADMIN_TOKEN` | — | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `USER_TZ` | `Europe/London` | buckets "civil days" + picks sleep midpoint |
| `LOOKBACK_DAYS` | `4` | how far back each sync re‑pulls |
| `SYNC_ACTIVITY` | `1` | steps/distance — `0` to avoid double‑counting |

```

## Limitations & roadmap

- **Restricted scopes.** Health scopes are "restricted"; an unverified app works for ≤100 users (perfect for personal use) but a long‑lived production token may require Google verification — otherwise re‑auth periodically.
- **Background timing.** Data appears after the Google Health app syncs the Air, so the Shortcut runs midday/evening rather than at dawn.
- **Roadmap:** swap polling for the Google Health API's webhook subscriptions (sleep trigger) + APNs push when they leave preview; optional menstrual/temperature metrics.
